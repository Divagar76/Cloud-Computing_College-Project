#Cloud Computing Security Challenges, Threats and Vulnerabilities.
Abstractâ€”Cloud computing has grown to become an
integral part of present as well as future information
technologies. This technology has been designed to be used
with internet by providing features such as information
storage, remote access, etc. Cloud computing has been proved
as an effective tool for all the provided services but it also
comes with various types of threats. Over the years of its
development, different fire attacks and data theft has been
reported as a crucial factor since the data stored in the cloud
by an organization or an individual user is basically
confidential and sensitive. These data are illegally accessed by
many hackers and further it will be used to fire attack the user.
This paper mainly aims to highlight such attacks and provide
suggestions for sorting the data breaching issues.
